  ## :black_nib: Built with
 - Java 17
 - Spring Boot
 - Spring Security
 - Spring Data JPA
 - ReactJS
 - MySQL
 - JavaScript
 - HTML, CSS - Without using bootstrap or other sites for helping me visualize the site.
 - Apache Maven
 - JWT token

 ## :dart: Features
 - Multi-language support. Could be runned from any device - responsive.
 - Users - _Can see all the sections, can like ,comment , sort by year descending if the section he is support years,
  can sort by likes descending, search bar combined with sorting operations. Users could change their given 
 information and change password.Could edit or delete only its own comments and unlike if torrent is liked earlier._
 - Admin - _Can edit and delete all the comments no matter who wrote them, can add torrents, ban users, change user 
 roles. Can search by email to see user information._

 ## What is in Backend
 - Filter - to check for valid jwt token
 - Interseptor - to check for blacklisted (banned) users everytime when request to server is made
 - Event and Listener - when user click on forgotten password and send the request for new password event is activated and the listener comes after
 - Schedule - checking every hour if 24 hours of user's ban have expired and if they have, remove the restriction of the user
 - <strong>Hibernate Validator - checks for invalid data</strong>
 - <strong>Custom exceptions and custom messages</strong>
 - <strong>Exception handling</strong>
 - JWT token
 - JavaMailSender, Cloudinary
 - AOP
 - I18n as well as in frontend
 - <strong>JUnit, Mockito - Unit and Integration tests</strong>
 - <strong>In-memory database (h2-Database) for Integration testing as well as in-memory email server (GreenMail)</strong>

 ## What is in Frontend
 - <strong>Using local storage - for storag–µ and extraction of JWT token</strong>
 - <strong>JWT decoding - to get the specific part of the JWT which hides the user information (email and role)</strong>
 - I18n
 - <strong>Exception handling</strong>
 - <strong>Custom pages for the different types of exceptions</strong>
 - <strong>Data validity checks</strong>
 - <strong>Custom messages if some of the data is not valid</strong>
 - <strong>!!!Page restrictions!!!</strong> If user is not logged in or doesn't have rights for some pages - he won't be able to access them because of FRONTEND restrictions and it will be redirected to login page, but if somehow he succeed, BACKEND will stop him!
